Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

**About Pixel manipulation**

Pixel manipulation refers to the process of altering the color values of individual pixels in an image. This manipulation can involve various operations such as changing brightness, contrast, saturation, applying filters, or transforming the pixel values according to specific algorithms. It's a fundamental technique used in image processing, computer graphics, and digital art to achieve desired visual effects or enhance image quality.
